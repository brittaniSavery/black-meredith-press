With an overactive brain and vibrant imagination, Brittani S. Avery is equal parts coder, writer, gamer, and nerd. She published her first novel, [_Element Unknown_](https://a.co/d/aT3onAA), in 2017, for which reviews praised the unique elemental typing system and character development in the science-fantasy adventure. Its direct sequel is currently in progress.

When she isnâ€™t writing or coding websites, she is often crocheting amigurumi (cute little animals mainly) or playing with her olde English bulldog, Jael. See what else she has running through her mind on her website at [brittanisavery.com](https://brittanisavery.com).
